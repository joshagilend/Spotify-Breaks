    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;""><strong>Show Notes:</strong> Dr. Peter Diamandis has been named one of “The World’s 50 Greatest Leaders" by Fortune Magazine. You asked for an entire episode with him, so here it is! The subject is simple: How to think big, and how to use the key strategies of Peter's friends and investors, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Larry Page. How do they create maximum leverage? How do they think differently? We explore all of this.SHOW NOTES and other links should be available shortly here. In the field of innovation, Diamandis is Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation. Among many other things, Diamandis is also the Co-Founder (along with Craig Venter and Bob Hariri) of Human Longevity Inc. (HLI); and Co-Founder of Planetary Resources, a company designing spacecraft to mine asteroids for precious materials (seriously). If I could ask one person to write one book, it would Peter and his new tome, Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth, and Impact the World. In fact, I have been asking him for years, and now it has arrived. The back cover also gave me serious blurb envy. Check out these testimonials from Bill Clinton, Eric Schmidt, and Ray Kurzweil. Ray says simply: “If you read one business book in the twenty-first century, this should be the one."</p>
